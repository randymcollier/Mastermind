Start by clicking the button corresponding to the level of difficulty you wish to play. Click any of the color circles to place it on the first gray peg. The first peg is the top left peg. The next peg is on its right. Once all the pegs on the top row have been filled in, the game will compare your choices to the solution. The number on the left corresponds to the number of colored pegs you selected that are the correct color and in the correct position. The number on the right corresponds to the remaining pegs that are the correct color but the wrong position. The active row of pegs will now be the one below the fully filled row. Continue this process until you correctly identify the solution or run out of guesses. If you mistakenly place a color on the row of pegs, you can remove it by clicking on it. You can only remove the most recent peg placed on the row. You may not remove a peg from a row once it has been compared to the solution. If you need a hint, you can click the "Hint" button to receive one. If you correctly identify the solution, your score will be calculated base on the level of difficulty you selected, the number of guesses it took you, the amount of time it took you, and how many hints you received. The top five scores for each level will be stored. If your score is higher than one of the current high scores, you will be prompted to enter your name to save it. To view the high scores, click the "Highscores" button. You can reset all the high scores by clicking the "Reset Highscores" button. Once you are finished, click "Done" to exit.
